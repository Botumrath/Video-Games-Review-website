            <h2>The best video games of 2022 ! </h2><br/>
            <p>It's not the end of 2022 yet but our team wanted to tell you what we think are the best games released so far. Whether because of shifting release calendars,
             less reliance on the retail sphere, or delays from the COVID-19 pandemic, the early months of 2022 have become a perfect storm of video game release.</p>
             <p>What follows is a comprehensive list of those games, blockbusters and indie standouts alike, that have already left a meteoric impact our team collective tastes.
             But also, we get it: Your time is precious, and even if you spend every second of your free time playing, you’ll never be able to knock these all out before
             the next wave of must-play games comes out. To that end, we’ve included rough estimates of how long it would take you to complete each game, citing figures 
             from the eternally helpful HowLongToBeat.</p>

            <h2>I am charmed by the uncertain future of video games</h2>
            <p>Games are in a constant state of flux, and I love it</p>
            <p>The video game industry changes a lot, and it’s always looking forward. It’s that time of year again when we’re excited to see all the new trailers, 
              and we’re thinking about the future not in terms of days, weeks, or even months, but years. With every new title that releases, we’re looking forward to seeing how 
              the graphics, gameplay, story, art, and music are going to push games even further, showing us something that the medium has never done before. The constant clamor 
              for new consoles has become even more prominent with the scarcity of new hardware from the ninth generation. There’s a constant force driving us forward, and while that’s 
              exciting, the sentimental side of me wants to slow down and smell the roses a little bit. I get whiplash just from looking at a side-by-side of video game graphics from almost thirty years ago to now.</p><br/>
