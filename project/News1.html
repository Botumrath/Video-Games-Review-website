            <h1>The best video games of 2022 ! </h1>
        </section>
        
        <div class="article_text">
            <p>It's not the end of 2022 yet but our team wanted to tell you what we think are the best games released so far. Whether because of shifting release calendars,
            less reliance on the retail sphere, or delays from the COVID-19 pandemic, the early months of 2022 have become a perfect storm of video game release.</p>
            <p>What follows is a comprehensive list of those games, blockbusters and indie standouts alike, that have already left a meteoric impact our team collective tastes.
            But also, we get it: Your time is precious, and even if you spend every second of your free time playing, you’ll never be able to knock these all out before
            the next wave of must-play games comes out. To that end, we’ve included rough estimates of how long it would take you to complete each game, citing figures 
            from the eternally helpful HowLongToBeat.</p><br/>

            <h3>Tunic</h3>
            <p>
                Few games on the planet trust you as much as Tunic does. The twee isometric adventure game, which casts you as a baby fox, barely explains a thing. 
                You soon find a stick, then a sword, then a shield, then a magic staff, and use that gear to beat up Zelda-inspired foes. Along the way, you piece together 
                an in-game instruction manual, deliciously styled like an old-school booklet, although even that doesn’t help clarify anything, as it’s written in a purposefully 
                abstruse runic language. Tunic is confusing. It’s tough (bosses in particular). You always feel like it’s one step ahead of you. But it’s also the sort of game that
                 unspools at a carefully plotted pace, that slowly unveils its secrets, every one more deliciously mind-bending than the last.

            <h3>Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands</h3>
            <p>
                With Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands, it feels as if Borderlands’ developers are finally comfortable letting go, and the results speak for themselves.
                 Wonderlands is a joyful romp through tabletop-RPG-inspired worlds, with seemingly minor tweaks that create huge ripples in the series’ “Diablo meets guns” formula. 
                 You can combine two disparate character classes, traverse a board-game style overworld, and pour dozens of hours into the phenomenal “Chaos Chamber” endgame. 
                 Through it all, Gearbox is willing to acknowledge that we’re not here for a script, or even a coherent narrative, and it leans into that sentiment with an appropriately 
                 scattershot story — it doesn’t take itself so seriously that it sacrifices unpredictability, joy, or the satisfaction of mesmerizing, well earned loot. —Mike Mahardy

            <h3>Norco</h3>
            <p>
                Norco is a Southern Gothic point-and-click adventure with a quality of writing all-too rarely seen in video games. This is a tale about returning to a childhood home in the wake of a 
                death, and discovering a community that is fracturing at its seams. Its magical realism-led depiction of the real-world town of Norco, on the banks of the Mississippi, delivers a subtle 
                science fiction take on our current plight of poverty, environmental destruction, and isolationism. And yet, it does all of this without ever wagging a finger, or 
                feeling like it’s delivering a “cautionary tale.” It’s compellingly smart, superbly told, and features some stunning pixel art.

            <h3>Elden Ring</h3>
            <p>
                Elden Ring is the culmination of the FromSoftware ethos established almost 30 years ago with the original King’s Field. But despite being the company’s biggest game to date, both in terms of 
                scale and popularity, it also knows how to get out of its own way. While Souls newcomers may struggle with Elden Ring’s vague goals and overall challenge, every minor frustration serves to make 
                its environmental storytelling and moments of triumph all the more compelling. Elden Ring is not a game that gently caresses your tired shoulders but one that latches onto your back like a demonic monkey, 
                an obsession made all the more difficult to shake by its copious checkpoints and the ease with which it allows you to drop in for a quick adventure, and then jet. If you previously wanted to get into the Souls 
                series but bounced off its lengthy dungeons and backtracking, Elden Ring may just be the FromSoftware game that finally gets you over that hump.
